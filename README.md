# DCGAN-AnimeFaces-Pytorch
This project utilizes a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate anime faces. The model is trained on a dataset of anime face images and can generate new, unique faces that resemble those in the training set.

# Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. DCGANs, or Deep Convolutional GANs, are a type of GAN that use convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers to generate high-quality images. In this project, we train a DCGAN to generate anime-style faces.
# Dataset

The dataset used for training consists of a large collection of anime face images. The images have been preprocessed to a consistent size of 64x64 pixels.
# Model Architecture

The DCGAN model consists of two main components:

    Generator: A neural network that generates new images from random noise.
    Discriminator: A neural network that tries to distinguish between real images and images generated by the generator.

The generator and discriminator are trained together in a two-player game: the generator tries to produce realistic images to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to identify which images are real and which are fake.
