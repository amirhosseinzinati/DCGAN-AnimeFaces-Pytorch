The generator generates a \"fake\" sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is \"real\" (picked from the training data) or \"fake\" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs.\n\nGANs however, can be notoriously difficult to train, and are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, activation functions and regularization.

Be mindful that training GANs is somewhat of an art form, as incorrect hyperparameter settings lead to mode collapse with little explanation of what went wrong. Here, we will closely follow Algorithm 1 from the Goodfellow’s paper, while abiding by some of the best practices shown in ganhacks. Namely, we will “construct different mini-batches for real and fake” images, and also adjust G’s objective function to maximize $ log(D(G(z)))$. Training is split up into two main parts. Part 1 updates the Discriminator and Part 2 updates the Generator.\n\nPart 1 - Train the Discriminator\n\nRecall, the goal of training the discriminator is to maximize the probability of correctly classifying a given input as real or fake. In terms of Goodfellow, we wish to “update the discriminator by ascending its stochastic gradient”. Practically, we want to maximize $ log(D(x))+log(1−D(G(z)))$. Due to the separate mini-batch suggestion from ganhacks, we will calculate this in two steps. First, we will construct a batch of real samples from the training set, forward pass through $D$, calculate the loss $(log(D(x)))$, then calculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct a batch of fake samples with the current generator, forward pass this batch through $D$, calculate the loss $(log(1−D(G(z))))$, and accumulate the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the gradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we call a step of the Discriminator’s optimizer.\n\nPart 2 - Train the Generator\n\nAs stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by minimizing $log(1−D(G(z)))$ in an effort to generate better fakes. As mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient gradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we instead wish to maximize $log(D(G(z)))$. In the code we accomplish this by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the Discriminator, computing G’s loss using real labels as GT, computing G’s gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating G’s parameters with an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real labels as GT labels for the loss function, but this allows us to use the $log(x)$ part of the BCELoss (rather than the $ log(1−x)$ part) which is exactly what we want.\n\nFinally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each epoch we will push our fixed_noise batch through the generator to visually track the progress of G’s training. The training statistics reported are:\n\n**Loss_D** - discriminator loss calculated as the sum of losses for the all real and all fake batches $(log(D(x))+log(1−D(G(z))))$.\n\n**Loss_G** - generator loss calculated as $log(D(G(z)))$\n\n**D(x)** - the average output (across the batch) of the discriminator for the all real batch. This should start close to 1 then theoretically converge to 0.5 when G gets better. Think about why this is.\n\n**D(G(z))** - average discriminator outputs for the all fake batch. The first number is before D is updated and the second number is after D is updated. These numbers should start near 0 and converge to 0.5 as G gets better.
